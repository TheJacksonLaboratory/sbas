# The impact of sex on alternative splicing

This repository documents the analysis pipeline and scripts we used for the analysis described in the manuscript *The impact of sex on alternative splicing*. 


## Access to GTEx data

In order to reproduce the results described in the manuscript, dbGAP access to the GTEx dataset is required. For our analysis, we used GTEx Analysis V8 (dbGaP Accession phs000424.v8.p2).

## Processing of the GTEx RNA-seq FASTQ files

## Analysis of gene and isoform read counts with Jupyter notebooks.

The package versions used to run the analysis are documented in TDODO.

To run the notebooks on the CloudOS Digital Research Environment, follow the instructions
in the [Dependencies](https://github.com/TheJacksonLaboratory/sbas/tree/master/dependencies) page to 
set up the environment.
