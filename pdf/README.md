## The folder `pdf`

### Why is this folder empty?

We use the folder **`pdf`** to store the pdf files with visualisations that are generated during the analysis, so this folder should appear empty on GitHub. We keep this folder so that upon i) `git clone` of this repo and ii) acquiring the input files provided with the publication you will be able to reuse the Jupyter Notebooks without the need to change filepaths in the code.
