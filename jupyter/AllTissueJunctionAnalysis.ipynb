    "This analysis uses edgeR.  From the documentation, it is important to note that normalization takes the form of correction factors that enter into the statistical model. Such correction factors are usually computed internally by edgeR functions, but it is also possible for a user to supply them. The correction factors may take the form of scaling factors for the library sizes, such as computed by calcNormFactors, which are then used to compute the effective library sizes. \n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, gene-specific correction factors can be entered into the glm functions of edgeR as offsets. In the latter case, the offset matrix will be assumed to account for all normalization issues, including sequencing depth and RNA composition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that normalization in edgeR is model-based, and the original read counts are not themselves transformed. This means that users should not transform the read counts in any way before inputing them to edgeR. For example, users should not enter RPKM or FPKM val- ues to edgeR in place of read counts. Such quantities will prevent edgeR from correctly estimating the mean-variance relationship in the data, which is a crucial to the statistical strategies underlying edgeR. Similarly, users should not add artificial values to the counts before inputing them to edgeR.\n",
    "\n",
    "edgeR is not designed to work with estimated expression levels, for example as might be output by Cufflinks. \n",
    "edgeR can work with expected counts as output by RSEM, but raw counts are still preferred. \n",

    "As instructed by the software, we are using the raw counts as provided by rMATS.  The raw counts we are using in the model are `ijc` and `sjc`, the sample specific raw read counts as they align to the junctions of the `included exon (ijc)` and the junctions of the `excluded or skipped exon (sjc)` respectively.\n",
